			<div class="item-advisory" id="advisory"> At your current temperature, there is at least a medium risk of frostbite. It is highly recommended that your limit your exposure outdoors, as frostbite can develop in 10 to 30 minutes even with proper protection. That being said, if you do go outside, make sure to travel in pairs or groups to consistently check for signs of frostbite and keep moving to keep your blood flow going.

At your current temperature, the biggest danger in terms of weather is heat exhaustion and dehydration. Wearing masks and a lack of bathrooms can cause people to not drink enough water during protests. To combat this, drink water before you go and bring water with you. It is important to know the symptoms of dehydration and heat exhaustion which include thirst, a lack of urination, dizziness, increased breathing, heavy sweating, and a rapid pulse. If you notice any of these symptoms, stop all activity, find a cooler area, and rehydrate. If symptoms worsen or don’t improve within an hour, seek medical help. In addition, even though it is warm, it is still important to wear long pants/leggings and long sleeves to protect you from the elements and any possible tripping or falling.";
